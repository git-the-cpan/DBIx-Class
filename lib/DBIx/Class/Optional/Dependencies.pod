=head1 NAME

DBIx::Class::Optional::Dependencies - Optional module dependency specifications (for module authors)


=head1 SYNOPSIS

Somewhere in your build-file (e.g. L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>'s F<Makefile.PL>):

  ...

  $EUMM_ARGS{CONFIGURE_REQUIRES} = {
    %{ $EUMM_ARGS{CONFIGURE_REQUIRES} || {} },
    'DBIx::Class' => '0.082899_03',
  };

  ...

  my %DBIC_DEPLOY_AND_ORACLE_DEPS = %{ eval {
    require DBIx::Class::Optional::Dependencies;
    DBIx::Class::Optional::Dependencies->req_list_for([qw( deploy rdbms_oracle icdt )]);
  } || {} };

  $EUMM_ARGS{PREREQ_PM} = {
    %DBIC_DEPLOY_AND_ORACLE_DEPS,
    %{ $EUMM_ARGS{PREREQ_PM} || {} },
  };

  ...

  ExtUtils::MakeMaker::WriteMakefile(%EUMM_ARGS);

B<Note>: The C<eval> protection within the example is due to support for
requirements during L<the C<configure> build phase|CPAN::Meta::Spec/Phases>
not being available on a sufficient portion of production installations of
Perl. Robust support for such dependency requirements is available in the
L<CPAN> installer only since version C<1.94_56> first made available for
production with perl version C<5.12>. It is the belief of the current
maintainer that support for requirements during the C<configure> build phase
will not be sufficiently ubiquitous until the B<year 2020> at the earliest,
hence the extra care demonstrated above. It should also be noted that some
3rd party installers (e.g. L<cpanminus|App::cpanminus>) do the right thing
with configure requirements independent from the versions of perl and CPAN
available.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Some of the less-frequently used features of L<DBIx::Class> have external
module dependencies on their own. In order not to burden the average user
with modules they will never use, these optional dependencies are not included
in the base Makefile.PL. Instead an exception with a descriptive message is
thrown when a specific feature can't find one or several modules required for
its operation. This module is the central holding place for the current list
of such dependencies, for DBIx::Class core authors, and DBIx::Class extension
authors alike.

Dependencies are organized in L<groups|/CURRENT REQUIREMENT GROUPS> where each
group can list one or more required modules, with an optional minimum version
(or 0 for any version). In addition groups prefixed with C<test_> can specify
a set of environment variables, some (or all) of which are marked as required
for the group to be considered by L</req_list_for>

Each group name (or a combination thereof) can be used in the
L<public methods|/METHODS> as described below.

=head1 IMPORT-LIKE ACTIONS

Even though this module is not an L<Exporter>, it recognizes several C<actions>
supplied to its C<import> method.

=head2 -skip_all_without

=over

=item Arguments: @group_names

=back

A convenience wrapper for use during testing:


 use DBIx::Class::Optional::Dependencies -skip_all_without => qw(admin test_rdbms_mysql);

Roughly equivalent to the following code:


 BEGIN {
   require DBIx::Class::Optional::Dependencies;
   if ( my $missing = DBIx::Class::Optional::Dependencies->req_missing_for(\@group_names_) ) {
     print "1..0 # SKIP requirements not satisfied: $missing\n";
     exit 0;
   }
 }



It also takes into account the C<RELEASE_TESTING> environment variable and
behaves like L</-die_without> for any requirement groups marked as
C<release_testing_mandatory>.

=head2 -die_without

=over

=item Arguments: @group_names

=back

A convenience wrapper around L</die_unless_req_ok_for>:


 use DBIx::Class::Optional::Dependencies -die_without => qw(deploy admin);


=head2 -list_missing

=over

=item Arguments: @group_names

=back

A convenience wrapper around L</modreq_missing_for>:

 perl -Ilib -MDBIx::Class::Optional::Dependencies=-list_missing,deploy,admin | cpanm

=head1 METHODS

=head2 req_group_list

=over

=item Arguments: none

=item Return Value: \%list_of_requirement_groups

=back

This method should be used by DBIx::Class packagers, to get a hashref of all
dependencies B<keyed> by dependency group. Each key (group name), or a combination
thereof (as an arrayref) can be supplied to the methods below.
The B<values> of the returned hash are currently a set of options B<without a
well defined structure>. If you have use for any of the contents - contact the
maintainers, instead of treating this as public (left alone stable) API.

=head2 req_list_for

=over

=item Arguments: $group_name | \@group_names

=item Return Value: \%set_of_module_version_pairs

=back

This method should be used by DBIx::Class extension authors, to determine the
version of modules a specific set of features requires for this version of
DBIx::Class (regardless of their availability on the system).
See the L</SYNOPSIS> for a real-world example.

When handling C<test_*> groups this method behaves B<differently> from
L</modreq_list_for> below (and is the only such inconsistency among the
C<req_*> methods). If a particular group declares as requirements some
C<environment variables> and these requirements are not satisfied (the envvars
are unset) - then the C<module requirements> of this group are not included in
the returned list.

=head2 modreq_list_for

=over

=item Arguments: $group_name | \@group_names

=item Return Value: \%set_of_module_version_pairs

=back

Same as L</req_list_for> but does not take into consideration any
C<environment variable requirements> - returns just the list of required
modules.

=head2 req_ok_for

=over

=item Arguments: $group_name | \@group_names

=item Return Value: 1|0

=back

Returns true or false depending on whether all modules/envvars required by
the group(s) are loadable/set on the system.

=head2 req_missing_for

=over

=item Arguments: $group_name | \@group_names

=item Return Value: $error_message_string

=back

Returns a single-line string suitable for inclusion in larger error messages.
This method would normally be used by DBIx::Class core features, to indicate to
the user that they need to install specific modules and/or set specific
environment variables before being able to use a specific feature set.

For example if some of the requirements for C<deploy> are not available,
the returned string could look like:


 "SQL::Translator~>=0.11018" (see DBIx::Class::Optional::Dependencies documentation for details)

The author is expected to prepend the necessary text to this message before
returning the actual error seen by the user. See also L</modreq_missing_for>

=head2 modreq_missing_for

=over

=item Arguments: $group_name | \@group_names

=item Return Value: $error_message_string

=back

Same as L</req_missing_for> except that the error string is guaranteed to be
either empty, or contain a set of module requirement specifications suitable
for piping to e.g. L<cpanminus|App::cpanminus>. The method explicitly does not
attempt to validate the state of required environment variables (if any).

For instance if some of the requirements for C<deploy> are not available,
the returned string could look like:


 "SQL::Translator~>=0.11018"


See also L</-list_missing>.

=head2 skip_without

=over

=item Arguments: $group_name | \@group_names

=back

A convenience wrapper around L<skip|Test::More/SKIP>. It does not take neither
a reason (it is generated by L</req_missing_for>) nor an amount of skipped tests
(it is always C<1>, thus mandating unconditional use of
L<done_testing|Test::More/done_testing>). Most useful in combination with ad hoc
requirement specifications:


  SKIP: {
    DBIx::Class::Optional::Dependencies->skip_without([ deploy YAML>=0.90 ]);

    ...
  }



=head2 die_unless_req_ok_for

=over

=item Arguments: $group_name | \@group_names

=back

Checks if L</req_ok_for> passes for the supplied group(s), and
in case of failure throws an exception including the information
from L</req_missing_for>. See also L</-die_without>.

=head2 modreq_errorlist_for

=over

=item Arguments: $group_name | \@group_names

=item Return Value: \%set_of_loaderrors_per_module

=back

Returns a hashref containing the actual errors that occurred while attempting
to load each module in the requirement group(s).

=head2 req_errorlist_for

Deprecated method name, equivalent (via proxy) to L</modreq_errorlist_for>.
